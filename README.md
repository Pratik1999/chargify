Chargify

Chargify is an Android app solution which is used to locate nearby charging stations for EVs (Electric Vehicles) depending on the location of the vehicle and range left in it. 

It has been built in response to test the feasibility of the EV ecosystem in India.

-- It provides a hassle-free experience to the users and will be their favourite choice for their charging experience.   

-- The data gathered from their Vehicle Information will be used to model demand for EVs of a particular company & a particular model in that region. 

-- The data gathered from their charging patterns such as preferred charging locations will be used to develop new charging stations in areas seeing high turnout and strengthen the grid to ensure Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) can provide  adequate power their 
with great efficiency.
